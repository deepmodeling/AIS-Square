## Introduction

A DP-PBE model for Ti-Mo alloys. Users can find more details of its training, validation and application in ref. [1]

## Training

Training data is generated by DP-GEN [2, 3]. We used the se_e2_a descriptor in DeepMD-kit [4], setting the cutoff to 9.0 Å with a smooth function imposed from 2.0 Å. The embedding network consists of three layers with sizes (25,50,100), and the fitting network includes three layers with sizes (240,240,240). The loss function minimized during training is:
$$
\begin{align}

 & L({{p}_{\varepsilon }},{{p}_{f}},{{p}_{\xi }})={{p}_{\varepsilon }}\Delta {{\varepsilon }^{2}}+\frac{{{p}_{f}}}{3N}\sum\limits_{i}{|\Delta {{\mathbf{F}}_{i}}|}+\frac{{{p}_{\xi }}}{9}{{\left\| \Delta \xi \right\|}^{2}} & 

\end{align}
$$
where *$N$* represents the number of atoms. $\Delta {\varepsilon }$, ${|\Delta {{\mathbf{F}}_{i}}|}$, ${\left\| \Delta \xi \right\|}$ and denote the difference between the DP model and DFT calculations for energy, atomic force, and virial tensors, respectively. The corresponding prefactors ${p}_{\varepsilon }$, ${p}_{f}$, and ${p}_{\xi }$ are adjusted in the training process. The training is conducted in two rounds, each with eight million steps. In the first round, the learning rate decays from $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-8}$ with the prefactors ${p}_{\varepsilon }$, ${p}_{f}$, and ${p}_{\xi }$ shifting from 0.001 to 1, 1000 to 1, and 0.01 to 1, respectively. The second round fine-tunes the trained DP model with a lower learning rate from $10^{-4}$  to $10^{-8}$, fixing the prefactors ${p}_{\varepsilon }$, ${p}_{f}$, and ${p}_{\xi }$ to 10, 1, and 1, respectively. It is important to note that fine-tuning typically improves energy and virial accuracy significantly while only minimally impacting force accuracy [5, 6].
