## Introduction

A DP-PBE model for W. **[1]**

Here, we propose a new three-body embedding descriptor and hybridize it into the Deep-Potential (DP) framework, an end-to-end deep learning interatomic potential model. Trained with the dataset generated by a concurrent learning method, the potential model for tungsten, named by DP-HYB, is able to accurately predict a wide range of properties including elastic constants, the formation energies of free surfaces, grain boundaries, point defects and defect clusters, stacking fault energies, the core structure of screw dislocation, the energy barrier and the transition path of the screw dislocation migration. Since most of the properties are not explicitly included in the training dataset, the strong generalizability of the DP-HYB model indicates that it is a good candidate for the atomistic simulations of tungsten property deterioration, especially those involving the mechanical property changing under the harsh service environment.

## Training

The DP-PBE model is constructed using a smooth edition of the Deep Potential model **[2]**. The DeePMD-kit package is used for training. In each iteration, four models are trained simultaneously using the same data set, with the only difference being the random seeds employed to initialize the model parameters. The sizes of the embedding and fitting nets are set to (25, 50, 100) and (240, 240, 240), respectively. The cut-off radius is set to 6 Å. The Adam stochastic gradient descent method55 with the default hyperparameter settings provided by the TensorFlow packag was used to train the DP models.

The starting and final learning rate was $1×10^{−3}$ and $5×10^{−8}$, respectively. In each DP-GEN **[3,4]** iteration the DP model is trained with $4.0×10^{5}$ steps. After the DP-GEN iterations converge, the final productive models are trained with $8.0×10^6$ steps.

More details can be found in **[1]**.

## Transfer learning

In the training step, the same training strategy as that used in the initialization stage of the transfer learning is adopted.
