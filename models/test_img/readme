## Introduction
Catalyst discovery and optimization is key to solving many societal and energy challenges including solar fuels synthesis, long-term energy storage, and renewable fertilizer production. A critical factor in building Machine Learning (ML) models is the data used for training. Much of the progress in applying ML in heterogeneous catalysis has been driven by increasingly large and diverse datasets of electronic structure calculations.

OC20 dataset is from `ocp`, the [Open Catalyst Project](https://opencatalystproject.org/)'s library of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for catalysis. OC20 consists of 1,281,040 Density Functional Theory (DFT) relaxations (∼264,890,000 single point evaluations) across a wide swath of materials, surfaces, and adsorbates (nitrogen, carbon, and oxygen chemistries) **[1]**. OC20 dataset is publicly available at http://opencatalystproject.org.

This dataset is a subset of OC20, named OC2M, consists of around 2 million DFT data samples covering 56 elements with energy and force labels processed in DeePMD's **[2]** [`mixed_type`](https://github.com/deepmodeling/deepmd-kit/blob/master/doc/model/train-se-atten.md#data-format) format. A standard input script to train the DPA-1 model **[3]** is also attached in the file.

## Generation Approach
Open Catalyst 2020 (OC20) dataset (Figure 1 below) comprises over 1.2 million DFT relaxations of molecular adsorptions onto surfaces (*ca.* 250 million single-point calculations) across a substantially large structure and chemistry space (Figure 2 below). 

While a dataset of this magnitude will lead to significant improvements in ML models, this is still an extremely sparse sampling of all possibilities. OC20 considers 82 different adsorbates (small adsorbates, C1/C2 compounds, and N/O-containing intermediates) that are relevant for renewable energy and environmental applications. Relaxations are performed on randomly sampled low-Miller-index facets of stable materials from the Materials Project **[4]**, resulting in surfaces from 55 different elements and mixtures thereof. For each of the calculations, OC20 includes relaxation trajectories, Bader charges, and LOBSTER **[5]**-calculated orbital information. 

To aid in training more robust models, OC20 additionally includes computations in short, high-temperature *ab initio* Molecular Dynamics (MD) trajectories on a randomly sampled subset of the relaxed states.  Random perturbations are conducted on the atomic positions in a subset of the structures along the relaxation pathways and single point DFT calculations are also performed for these perturbed/rattled structures.

This dataset for download is a subset of OC20, named OC2M, containing around 2 million DFT data points which are randomly sampled from OC20. This dataset with energy and force labels is proper for training potential energy models and predicting the energy and force for a given state.

See **[1]** for more details on generation approach of OC20.

## Data Format
The directory tree is as follows:

```
OC2M
-- train
-- -- [num_atom]
-- -- -- sys.xxxx
-- valid
-- -- [num_atom]
-- -- -- sys.xxxx
-- input.json
```

where each subdirectory (`[num_atom]`) consists of several systems `sys.xxxx` in DeePMD's  [`mixed_type`](https://github.com/deepmodeling/deepmd-kit/blob/master/doc/model/train-se-atten.md#data-format)  format, each of which contains `num_atom` atoms. `input.json` is a standard input script to train the DPA-1 model **[3]**.

Each unit system  `sys.xxxx` in mixed_type format usually has the following substructure:

```
-- sys.xxxx
-- -- type_map.raw
-- -- type.raw
-- -- set.000/box.npy
-- -- set.000/coord.npy
-- -- set.000/energy.npy
-- -- set.000/force.npy
-- -- set.000/virial.npy
-- -- set.000/real_atom_types.npy
```
