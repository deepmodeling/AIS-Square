# V-PBE

## Introduction

This is the DP model for V PBE functional model used in **[1]**.

## Training

For DP-HYB-V, we use the general Deep potential generator (DP-GEN) scheme with the new hybrid descriptor and a “specialization” strategy to generate the training datasets. The new hybrid descriptor includes two- and three-body functions modelled by embedding neural networks of sizes (20,40,80) and (4,8,16), respectively. The fitting neural network size is (240, 240, 240). The cutoff radii for the two- and three-body embedding neural networks are 6 and 4 Å, respectively. In all the training stages, four models are trained on the same training datasets with the same neural network sizes but starting from different random seeds.

More details can be found in **[1]**.
