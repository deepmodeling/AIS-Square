## Introduction

A DeePMD model for Ti-dislocation used in **[1]**.

## Training

Atomistic modelling of Ti is challenging as empirical and semi-empirical interatomic potentials have limited capabilities in describing the bonding characteristics in different Ti allotropes (ω, α and β ). An MEAM interatomic potential and a recent ML Deep Potential **[2]** have been shown to possess the necessary attributes for modelling dislocations in multiphase Ti in a self-consistent manner **[2]**. In particular, these two potentials accurately capture the cohesive energies, elastic constants and generalised stacking fault energies of both the HCP-α and BCC- β phases. In the current work, we employ an improved version of the Deep Potential for Ti (DP-Ti). DP-Ti is trained using the DeePMD-kit **[3]** through a workﬂow consisting of “Initialisation”, “DP-GEN loop”, and “Specialisation” steps. The detailed training process and benchmarks are described in Ref. **[2]**. Here, we brieﬂy describe the improvements made relative to the earlier version **[2]**. The current training datasets include additional ab initio MD-based 2×2×2 super cells of the ω-phase. In the specialisation-step, the training datasets include segments of the γ -line in the 〈 a 〉 direction on the { 10¯10 } -prism I wide plane and in the 〈 c + a 〉 direction on the pyramidal II plane (Fig. 1).
