# Introduction
A DP-PBE model for Al-doped boron carbide (B<sub>12</sub>-CAlC). [1]

Here, an accurate machine-learning force field (ML-FF), named as BCAl-PBE-model, is developed for BCAl systems based on extensive quantum mechanics (QM) simulations. We apply this ML-FF to investigate the plastic deformation mechanisms in superhard boron carbide as a small amount of aluminum (Al) is doped. Under shear deformation, dislocation nucleation and glide occur in Al-doped boron carbide (B<sub>12</sub>-CAlC) due to the breakage of weakened chain bonds rather than the disintegration of icosahedral clusters. The dislocation activities then cause twin boundaries to migrate, thereby mitigating amorphization and enhancing ductility. Furthermore, the mobile dislocation with the Burgers vector of b=⟨1$\bar{1}$0⟩{111} is observed in the tensile nanopillar, which is well consistent with the experiment. This Letter demonstrates that mobile dislocation could be activated in superstrong covalent materials through a simple doping strategy.

# Training
The BCAl-PBE-model is constructed using DeePMD-kit package (v2.1.3) [2]. The DeePMD-kit package is used for training. The sizes of the embedding and fitting nets are set to (25, 50, 100) and (120, 120, 120), respectively. The cut-off radius is set to 5.2 Å and the smoothing starts from 5.0 Å. The Adam stochastic gradient descent method with the default hyperparameter settings provided by the TensorFlow packag was used to train the DP models.The learning rate varies from 0.001 to 3.51 × 10<sup>–8</sup> with an exponential decay in the total of 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> training steps. The model compression scheme was applied in this work for boosting the computational efficiency of the MD simulation [3].
