# Introduction
A DPA-1 model for HfTaCN rocksalt ceramics trained by using the Deepmd-kit-V2.2.4 software. Users can find more details of its training, validation and application in ref. [1].

# Training
Training data is generated by DP-GEN [2, 3]. We used the se_atten_v2 descriptor in DeepMD-kit [4], setting the cutoff to 7.0 Å with a smooth function imposed from 2.0 Å. The embedding network consists of three layers with sizes (20,40,80), and the fitting network includes three layers with sizes (128,128,128). The loss function minimized during training is:


$L(p_\epsilon,p_f,p_\xi)=p_\epsilon(\Delta\epsilon)^2+\frac{p_f}{3N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{j=1}^{3}(\Delta F_{ij})^2+\frac{p_\xi}{9}\sum_{k=1}^{9}(\Delta \xi_k)^2$.

The first, second, and third part are corresponding to energy error, force error, and stress error (Virial error), respectively.
