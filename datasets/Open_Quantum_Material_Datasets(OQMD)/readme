# Open Quantum Material Datasets (OQMD)

## Introduction

High-throughput density functional theory (HT DFT) is fast becoming a powerful tool for accelerating materials design and discovery by the amassing tens and even hundreds of thousands of DFT calculations in large databases. Complex materials problems can be approached much more efficiently and broadly through the sheer quantity of structures and chemistries available in such databases. 

The Open Quantum Material Datasets (OQMD), is a high-throughput database of DFT calculated thermodynamic and structural properties of **1,022,603** materials, created in [Chris Wolverton's](https://www.wolverton.northwestern.edu/) group at Northwestern University. **[1]** The OQMD contains approximately 300,000 calculated structures. These structures come primarily from two sources: 10% from the ICSD and 90% from iterating over many chemistries for several simple prototypes.

* 16 elemental prototypes are included. Their strukturbericht and common prototype names are:

| A1   | A2   | A3   | A3'      | A4      | A5      | A7       | A9       | A10      | A11      | A12      | A13     | A_a  | A_b    | A_h      | C19      |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | -------- | ------- | ------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | ------- | ---- | ------ | -------- | -------- |
| FCC  | BCC  | HCP  | alpha-La | diamond | beta-Sn | alpha-As | graphite | alpha-Hg | alpha-Ga | alpha-Mn | beta-Mn | BCT  | beta-U | alpha-Po | alpha-Sm |

* Binary prototypes and their compositions include:

| B2   | D0_3 | L1_0 | L1_1 | L1_2 | B_h  | B_19 | D0_19 | B1   | B3   | B4   | D0_22 |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----- |
| XY   | X3Y  | XY   | XY   | X3Y  | XY   | XY   | X3Y   | XY   | XY   | XY   | X3Y   |

* Ternary prototypes and their compositions include:

| L2_1 Heusler | Perovskite | Brownmillerite |
| ------------ | ---------- | -------------- |
| X2Y2O5       | X2YZ       | XYO3           |

Besides, the research group demonstrated a method to significantly accelerate materials discovery by using a machine learning (ML) model trained on density functional theory (DFT) data from the Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD).  Wolverton et al. **[2]** used it to predict 55 previously unknown, stable quaternary Heusler compounds. The accuracy of is higher when trained using the diversity of crystal structures available in the OQMD than when training on well-curated datasets which contain only a single family of crystal structures, it shows how large datasets, such as OQMD, are particularly valuable for materials discovery. See **[3]** to find more OQMD applications in materials problems.

## Generation Approach

All DFT calculations are performed with the [Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP)](https://www.vasp.at/), version 5.3.2. The electron exchange and correlation are described with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of [Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof](http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.77.3865) (PBE), using the potentials supplied by VASP with the [projected augmented wave (PAW)](http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.59.1758) method. PAW-PBE potentials for 89 elements are supplied with VASP and we follow the [VASP guidelines](http://cms.mpi.univie.ac.at/vasp/vasp/Two_versions_PP_which_one_should_be_used.html) concerning the optimum choice of potentials. For the 4f elements, we employ potentials where the valence f-electrons are treated as core electrons (appended with _2 and _3). The complete list of elements in the OQMD, and their potentials, are listed [here](https://oqmd.org/documentation/pots). For all structures, gamma-centered k-point meshes were constructed based on reciprocal space cell dimensions and the k-point density, defined by the number of k-points per reciprocal atom (KPPRA). The electronic ground states were converged to within 0.0001 eV/atom and the crystal structure to within 0.001 eV/atom. **[4]**

### Relaxation Scheme 

The relaxation of a structure in the OQMD consists of four consecutive DFT calculations:

#### Initialize

We begin with the given ICSD structure parameters and perform an initial, low quality static calculation. At this step we evaluate whether or not further calculations of the structure should include magnetism, as well as eliminate structures which are sufficiently unphysical as to prohibit the well behaved convergence of their electronic-structure. A KPPRA of 4000 is used.

#### Coarse Relax

Next, a coarse relaxation is performed with the plane wave basis set energy cutoff at the maximum defined in the VASP potentials of the elements in a given structure. The KPPRA is kept at 4000. 

#### Fine Relax

Then the structure undergoes a finer relaxation calculation with a higher energy cutoff and denser k-point mesh (KPPRA=6000). In these relaxation steps, partial orbital occupations are described by the Methfessel-Paxton method of order one, with a smearing width of 0.2 eV.

#### Standard

Lastly, a final, high quality static calculation of the structure is performed at an energy cutoff of 520 eV. This constant cutoff ensures all the energies calculated in OQMD are comparable as all the previous steps have used a cutoff which varies depending on the atomic species in the calculation. A denser k-point mesh is also employed, KPPRA=8000. 

### Element-specific DFT Settings 

Several element-specific settings are included as well. Any calculation containing 3d (Sc-Cu) or actinide elements are spin-polarized with a ferromagnetic alignment of spins to capture possible magnetism, with initial magnetic moments of 5 and 7 muB, respectively. It should be noted that this approach will not capture more complex magnetic ordering, such as antiferromagnetism, which [has been found](http://prb.aps.org/abstract/PRB/v85/i11/e115104) to result in errors to the formation energy on the order of 10-20 meV/atom. For several transition metals, lanthanides, and actinides, the GGA+U approach is implemented to improve the exchange and correlation description of the localized charge density when in compounds with oxygen. We employed the Dudarev approach to GGA+U, where the only input parameter is U-J. For several transition metals, [previously determined](http://prb.aps.org/abstract/PRB/v73/i19/e195107) U-J values were used, whereas for others a value of 4 eV was assumed. All U-J values are given in the following table:

| **Element** |  V   |  Cr  |  Mn  |  Fe  |  Co  |  Ni  |  Cu  |  Th  |  U   |  Np  |  Pu  |
| :---------: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
|   **U-J**   | 3.1  | 3.5  | 3.8  | 4.0  | 3.3  | 6.4  | 4.0  | 4.0  | 4.0  | 4.0  | 4.0  |

## Data Format

To maximise the impact of these data, the entire database is being made available, without restrictions, at www.oqmd.org/download. It is provided in SQL file format and the size is about 86G after extraction,  After importing into the database, the size is about 150G. You are supposed to prepare at least 500G free space for the importing.
