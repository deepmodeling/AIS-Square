System:
The set of data contains structure-to-energy-force labels for 20 semiconductors, 
namely, Si, Ge, SiC, BAs, BN, AlN, AlP, AlAs, InP, InAs, InSb, GaN, GaP, GaAs, CdTe, InTe-In2Te3, CdSe-CdSe2, InSe-In2Se3, ZnS, CdS-CdS2. 
DFT:
The DFT-based electronic structure calculations are computed by ABACUS with numerical atomic orbitals and used triple-zeta plus double 
polarization (TZDP) basis sets. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in the form of the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) was used for 
the exchange–correlation functional. The norm-conserving pseudopotentials were employed and the valence configurations were [B]2s$$^2$$2p$$^1$$, 
[C]2s$$^2$$2p$$^2$$, [N]2s$$^2$$2p$$^3$$, [Al]3s$$^2$$3p$$^1$$, [Si]3s$$^2$$3p$$^2$$, [P]3s$$^2$$3p$$^3$$, [S]3s$$^2$$3p$$^4$$, 
[Zn]3s$$^2$$3p$$^6$$3d$$^{10}$$4s$$^2$$, [Ga]4s$$^2$$4p$$^1$$, [Ge]4s$$^2$$4p$$^2$$, [As]4s$$^2$$4p$$^3$$, [Se]4s$$^2$$4p$$^4$$, 
[Cd]4s$$^2$$4p$$^6$$4d$$^{10}$$5s$$^2$$, [In]4d$$^{10}$$ 5s$$^2$$5p$$^1$$, [Sb]5s$$^2$$5p$$^3$$, and [Te]4d$$^{10}$$ 5s$$^2$$5p$$^4$$, respectively. 
The numerical atomic orbitals were 3s3p2d for B, 3s3p2d for C, 3s3p2d for N, 3s3p2d for Al, 3s3p2d for Si, 3s3p2d for P, 3s3p2d for S, 6s3p3d2f for 
Zn, s3p2d for Ga, 3s3p2d for Ge, 3s3p2d for As, 3s3p2d for Se, 6s3p3d2f for Cd, 3s3p3d2f for In, 3s3p2d for Sb, and 3s3p3d2f for Te, respectively. 
The cutoff orbitals are set to 9 a.u.. The energy cutoff is set to 100 Ry. The K-points are set using the Monkhorst–Pack mesh with the spacing 0.08 1/a.u.. 
We employed the Gaussian smearing method with the smearing widths of 0.002 Ry. The electronic iteration convergence threshold was set to 10$$^{-6}$$.
