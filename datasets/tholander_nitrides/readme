## Introduction

A challenging data set for quantum machine learning containing a diverse set of 12.8k polymorphs in the Zn-Ti-N, Zn-Zr-N and Zn-Hf-N chemical systems. The phase diagrams of the Ti-Zn-N, Zr-Zn-N, and Hf-Zn-N systems are determined using large-scale high-throughput density functional calculations (DFT-GGA) (PBE), as shown in **FIG. 1**. In total 12,815 relaxed structures are shared alongside their energy calculated using the VASP DFT code. The High-Throughput Toolkit was used to manage the calculations. Data adapted and deduplicated from the original data on Zenodo at [**[1]**](https://zenodo.org/record/5530535#.YjJ3ZhDMJLQ), published under MIT licence. Collated from separate files of chemical systems and deduplicated according to identical structures matching ht_ids.

## Generation Approach

Density functional theory (DFT) was used to study the TM-Zn-N alloys (TM = Ti, Zr, Hf). The calculations were performed using projected augmented wave (PAW) type pseudopotentials using the Perdew-Burke-Ernhofer generalized gradient approximation (PBE-GGA) for the exchange-correlation functional as implemented in the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) (v5.4.1). **[2]**

All calculations were done using a 600 eV plane-wave energy cutoff. The bandgap calculations were performed using PBEGGA and a $21 \times 21 \times 21$ Monkhorst-Pack type k-mesh. The piezoelectric and elastic tensors for the TiZnN~2~ structure were calculated with a $11 \times 11 \times 11$ Monkhorst-Pack k-mesh. The ZrZnN~2~ and HfZnN~2~ tensors were calculated using a $15 \times 15 \times 15$ k-mesh. The piezoelectric calculations were performed using density functional perturbation theory as implemented in VASP in order to calculate the proper piezoelectric constants.

## Data Format

The original data can be downloaded from [[1]](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5530535) and stored in a `pandas` `DataFrame` with the structures being serialised as `pymatgen` `Structure` objects. The easiest way to load the data is to use the convenience method from `matminer` to decode the `pymatgen` objects.

```python
from matminer.utils.io import load_dataframe_from_json

df_Ti = load_dataframe_from_json("Zn-Ti-N.json.gz")
df_Zr = load_dataframe_from_json("Zn-Zr-N.json.gz")
df_Hf = load_dataframe_from_json("Zn-Hf-N.json.gz")
```

Each `DataFrame` contains the following columns:

1. `material_id` - A human readable unique identifier for each material
2. `ht_id` - The unique hash used to track the material in `httk`
3. `initial_structure` - The initial structure before relaxation
4. `final_structure` - The final structure after relaxation
5. `E_vasp_per_atom` - The VASP calculated energy per atom for the final structure

Or you can download the organized dataset from [here](https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/34423997), and load the data as `pandas` `DataFrame` as follows: 

```python
from matminer.datasets import load_dataset

df = load_dataset("tholander_e_form.json.gz")
```

**Number of entries:** 12815
