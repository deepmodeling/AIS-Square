## Introduction

**Description**

The dataset employed in this study is generated using DPGEN [1,2], a concurrent learning scheme that iteratively produces the DP training dataset.

 This dataset encompasses more than 1,400,000 structures of various elements, including H, C, N, O, F, Cl, S, and P, with up to 70 heavy atoms (N). The initial training data was obtained by optimizing small molecules (N≤10 and 10<N≤20) derived from the ChEMBL database, utilizing Gaussian 16 at the wB97XD/6-31G** level. This optimization process resulted in over 385,000 conformations. 

Subsequently, additional conformations of molecules (N≤10 and 10<N≤20) were explored through high-temperature (750K) DeePMD simulations using DPGEN + DPA-1 [3], which expanded the training set to approximately 750,000 conformations. The training set was further augmented by optimizing larger molecules from the ChEMBL database (N≤70) and conducting additional 750K DeePMD simulations on these optimized samples. Moreover, unoptimized structures generated from RD-kit with 20<N≤70 were randomly selected from the ChEMBL database and subjected to 750K DeePMD simulations, eventually enlarging the training set to around 1,100,000 conformations. 

In order to enhance torsion coverage, structures with a relative energy greater than 1.0 kcal/mol from the ChEMBL torsion scans dataset were optimized and simulated via 750K DeePMD simulations. Lastly, enhanced sampling MD simulations with structures obtained from a set of 1,473 molecules (N=20) further improved conformation sampling, ultimately contributing more than 25,000 structures to the dataset.

## Data Format

The directory tree is as follows:

```
sys_dir (optional)
-- train.txt
-- valid.txt
sys_dir_downstream (optional)
-- train.txt
-- valid.txt
*other_data_dirs
```

The dataset encompasses upstream and/or downstream splits, which are used for training DPA [3] models. Each system is represented as a single line in *.txt files in the DeePMD [4] format for training/validation. To obtain system paths from unstructured *$other\_data\_dirs$, one can refer to these *.txt files.

A nopbc unit system in DeePMD format usually has the following substructure:

```
-- system
-- -- type_map.raw
-- -- type.raw
-- -- set.000/coord.npy
-- -- set.000/energy.npy
-- -- set.000/force.npy
-- -- set.000/virial.npy
```
