## Introduction

Electronic transport in materials is governed by a series of tensorial properties such as conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and effective mass. These quantities are paramount to the understanding of materials in many fields from thermoelectrics to electronics and photovoltaics. Transport properties can be calculated from a material’s band structure using the Boltzmann transport theory framework. We present here the largest computational database of electronic transport properties based on a large set of 48,000 materials originating from the Materials Project database. **[1, 2]**

Here is an ab-initio electronic transport database for inorganic materials. Complex multivariable BoltzTraP simulation data is condensed down into tabular form of two main motifs: average eigenvalues at set moderate carrier concentrations and temperatures, and optimal values among all carrier concentrations and temperatures within certain ranges. Here are reported the average of the eigenvalues of conductivity effective mass (mₑ^cond^), the Seebeck coefficient (S), the conductivity (σ), the electronic thermal conductivity (κ~e~), and the Power Factor (PF) at a doping level of 10^18^ cm^-3^ and at a temperature of 300 K for n- and p-type. Also, the maximum values for S, σ, PF, and the minimum value for κ~e~ chosen among the temperatures [100, 1300] K, the doping levels [10^16^, 10^21^] cm^-3^, and doping types are reported. The properties that depend on the relaxation time are reported divided by the constant value 10^-14^. The average of the eigenvalues for all the properties at all the temperatures, doping levels, and doping types are reported in the tables for each entry. Data is indexed by materials project id (mpid). In **Fig. 1** and **Fig. 2**, we present some of the transport properties stored in the current database.

**Fig.1 | Seebeck versus electron conductivity (divided by τ).** The color represents the power factor (S2σ)and the pointsize is used for band gap. The reported values are averages over the three direction for T = 600 K and n- and p-type doping level (Dop) of 10^20^ cm ^−3^. Only materials with band gap higher than 0.1 eV in GGA are considered.

**Fig. 2 | Electron contribution of the thermal conductivity versus electron conductivity: (both divided by τ).** The values are averages over three direction for T = 600 K. Only materials with band gap equal to zero eV in GGA are considered. The blue line represents the Wiedemann-Franz law that holds for metals.

## Generation Approach

The results were obtained through the interpolation approach developed in the BoltzTraP software, assuming a constant relaxation time. The input data needed to run BoltzTraP are the crystal structure and the electronic band structure on a uniform grid. Both of these inputs are computed using the standard high-throughput density functional theory (HT-DFT) recipe from the MP summarized in refs **[3]**. The DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and adopting the projector augmented-wave (PAW) approach. For transition metal oxides with localized d orbitals, the GGA+U method was employed setting the MP standard Hubbard corrections. Most of the structures contained in the MP database originate from the Inorganic Crystal Structures Database (ICSD). The others come from previous high-throughput projects (e.g., a Li-ion battery screening project **[3]**) as well as from other databases (e.g., the Open Quantum Materials Database). All structures were fully-relaxed (cell and atomic positions) using a two-step procedure, until the energy difference is lower than 0.0005 eV/atoms. All relaxations were performed with spin polarization on and initializing magnetic ions in a high-spin ferromagnetic. For subsequent calculations spin-polarization was retained only when the relaxation results demonstrated non-zero atomically projected magnetic moments. The band structure calculations were determined for standard primitive cells according to the conventions of Setyawan and Curtarolo **[4]**. A self-consistent static calculation was first performed in order to converge the charge density using a moderate k-point density to sample the Brillouin zone (90 k-points per Å^−3^ (reciprocal lattice volume) for large gap systems (≥0.5 eV) and of 450 k-points per Å^−3^ for those with small gap (<0.5 eV). The tetrahedron method has been used for the band structure integration over k space in most of the cases. Whenever this method fails, the Gaussian smearing method has been used **[3]**. Then, two non-selfconsistent calculations were performed to evaluate the band structures: the first one along symmetry lines as defined in ref. **[4]** and the second one on an uniform k-point grid (1,000 k-points per Å^−3^ for large band gap systems, i.e., ≥0.5 eV, estimated from self-consistent runs and 1,500 k-points per Å^−3^ for small band gap systems i.e., <0.5 eV). Spin-orbit coupling was not considered in the current study, but could be implemented as a next step to refine the database.

Doping (i.e., introduction of additional carriers either holes or electrons) has a tremendous effect on electronic transport properties. Doping will set the Fermi level (μ) and directly influence the values of the transport properties. A first dataset provides all the transport quantities for both n-type and p-type doping at fixed doping levels ranging from 10^16^ to 10^20^ cm^−3^, increasing the doping by one order of magnitude at each step. A second and finer dataset provides the electronic transport properties at various Fermi level energies (on a uniform bin from −1.5 to 1.5 eV around the Fermi level with an energy increment of 0.005 eV), and temperatures (ranging from 100 to 1,300 K with an increment of 100 K).
