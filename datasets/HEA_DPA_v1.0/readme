## Introduction

**Description**

This data set is generated with DPGEN [1,2],  a concurrent learning scheme that generates the DP training dataset iteratively.

The High Entropy Alloy (HEA) dataset includes bulk TaNbWMoVAl alloy systems of various configurations and compositions. 
We employ DP-GEN to explore the composition space, starting from Ta$$_3$$Nb$$_3$$W$$_3$$Mo$$_3$$V$$_3$$Al$$_1$$, a 16-atom unit cell containing the former 5 elements as main components and Al as an additive. 
The exploration temperature range is around 50.0 K to 388.1 K and the pressure range is around 1 bar to 50000 bar.

## Data Format

The directory tree is as follows:

```
sys_dir (optional)
-- train.txt
-- valid.txt
sys_dir_downstream (optional)
-- train.txt
-- valid.txt
*other_data_dirs
```

The dataset encompasses upstream and/or downstream splits, which are used for training DPA [3] models. Each system is represented as a single line in *.txt files in the DeePMD [4] format for training/validation. To obtain system paths from unstructured *$other\_data\_dirs$, one can refer to these *.txt files.

A pbc unit system in DeePMD format usually has the following substructure:

```
-- system
-- -- type_map.raw
-- -- type.raw
-- -- set.000/box.npy
-- -- set.000/coord.npy
-- -- set.000/energy.npy
-- -- set.000/force.npy
-- -- set.000/virial.npy
```
