## Introduction

This is the dataset of DFT data in Ti-Mo alloys for training DeepMD model.



## General Approach

The DFT data from a previous study on pure Ti [1] — proven to accurately depict thermodynamic phase transformations — was included in the training dataset for Ti-Mo potentials. We prepared the new DFT data for Ti-Mo alloys using a concurrent-learning scheme implemented in DP-GEN (Deep Generator) [2, 3], which explores the configurational space through training, exploration, and labeling steps.

In the **training** step, we used DeepMD-kit [4] and built four DP models using different activation functions and initialization parameters based on an existing DFT dataset. The initial dataset for the first training step included BCC, HCP, and FCC phases with random distortions, atomic displacements, and Mo arrangements. 

The **exploration** step involved conducting hybrid Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics simulations under various temperature and pressure conditions using LAMMPS [5]. Our dataset incorporated supercells of 6~32 atoms for BCC, HCP, and FCC structures, with compositions up to 30% Mo, and the temperature gradually increased from 100 K to 3500 K during DP-GEN iterations. Pressures ranged from -5 to 20 GPa. We noted a significant model deviation when a configuration was inadequately described by the current DP models, defined as the maximum standard deviation of predicted atomic forces by the four trained DP models. The configurations with model deviations from 0.15 eV/Å to 0.35 eV/Å were randomly selected for the training dataset; for liquid structures, this range was adjusted to 0.30-0.60 eV/Å. An upper limit for the model deviation was set to prevent the inclusion of potentially unphysical configurations in the dataset. 

In the **labeling** step, we calculated the energy, atomic forces, and virials of selected configurations using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [6, 7] with the PBE exchange-correlation functional [8]. We set the plane-wave cutoff at 650 eV and a Monkhorst-Pack k-mesh with a k-spacing of 0.10 Å-1 to ensure convergence of energies, atomic forces, and virials for both the distorted crystals and liquid structures of Ti-Mo alloys.
