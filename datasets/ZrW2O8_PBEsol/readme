##  Introduction
This dataset cnontains DFT samples in DeepMD format used in [1].

##  Generation Approach
We use the DP Generator (DP-GEN)[2] to generate a set of training data that covers an enough wide range of relevant configurational space efficiently.We start with DFT optimized ground-state structures of P213 cubic phase ZrW2O8. The DFT calculated lattice constant with Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof solid (PBEsol)is 9.215 angstrom.The initial training dataset in the first iteration is obtained by performing a 10-step ab initio MD simulation for randomly perturbed 44 atoms cubic cell at 50 K. After labeling candidate configurations, self-consistent DFT calculations were performed subsequently. The DFT calculations were performed using a plane-wave basis set with a cutoff energy of 500 eV as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package[3,4] and the electron exchange-correlation potential was described using the generalized gradient approximation and PBEsol scheme[5]. The Brillouin zone was sampled with a 4 4 4 Monkhorst-Pack k-point grid for the cubic unit cell.

## Data Format

```bash
data
-- dataset
-- -- init.xxx
-- -- sys.xxx
-- dpgen_initbulk
-- dpgen_run
```

where each subdirectory contains unit systems in DeePMD format.

A pbc unit system usually has the following substructure:

```bash
-- system
-- -- type_map.raw
-- -- type.raw
-- -- set.000/box.npy
-- -- set.000/coord.npy
-- -- set.000/energy.npy
-- -- set.000/force.npy
```
