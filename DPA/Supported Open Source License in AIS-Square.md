| Software | **LGPL 3.0**  | The LGPL3.0 license allows others to freely copy, modify, and distribute software, but unlike GPL3.0, dynamically linked libraries under the LGPL license can be used with non-GPL licensed software. This means that when a dynamically linked library under the LGPL license is combined with other software, the other software does not need to comply with the LGPL license. However, if the LGPL-licensed library is modified, the modified library must comply with the LGPL license. |
